#lang racket/unit

;; This module provides a unit for typechecking contracts. The points of entry
;; are two functions check-contract-app and check-contract.

;; Each type rule for contracts proceeds by finding annotated pieces of syntax
;; in the expansion. The typed versions of the contract forms (those in
;; (base-env contract-prims)) annotate the surface syntax before delegating to
;; the untyped form. The typechecking rules in this unit are where we finally
;; use those annotations.

;; The function tc-arrow-i-contract typechecks the expansion of the TR's ->i
;; macro. That macro annotates each sub-contract's RHS (e.g. the actual
;; domain/range contract) with its surface identifier, its relative position in
;; the function signature, whether it's mandatory, as well as a few more details
;; before delegating to Racket's ->i. tc-arrow-i-contract uses that information
;; to recover the order of each sub-contract so that it can typecheck them in
;; the correct order and determine the contract's type.

;; What makes this type rule difficult is that the typed ->i macro only sees
;; each contract's and its dependencies' surface syntax, which means that's all
;; it can put in the annotations for this function to recover---during
;; typechecking, though, all of the dependencies' identifiers in ->i's expansion
;; are not necessarily the same as the surface identifiers stored in the
;; annotation. To use the information from the typed ->i macro we must relate
;; the surface identifiers to the expanded identifiers.

;; Consider the following piece of the domain from an ->i use, [x (d1 d2) ctc],
;; which has name x, dependencies d1 and d2, and contract ctc. To support
;; correlating the surface dependency identifiers with the expanded identifiers,
;; TR's ->i macro rewrites ctc to (begin d1 d2 ctc) before delegating. This
;; allows the type rule to retrieve the expanded d1 and d2 and correlate them
;; with the surface versions stored in the annotation, at the cost of leaking
;; the result of this rewrite to the user when ->i raises errors about syntax
;; and contract violations.
