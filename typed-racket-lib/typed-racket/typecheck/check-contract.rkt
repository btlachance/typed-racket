;; main data structure: list of expanded ctc forms first

;; 1) topo-sort this list via a helper function, and then the type rule will
;; just operate on that sorted list

;; Note: we'll still have to handle the surface/expanded dep list association, but
;; that will be common code b/w the doms and multi-value range checking

;; 2) When checking the current contract (call it "sub"), we must extend the
;; environment with a mapping from each of sub's dependencies' expanded
;; identifiers to their output types -- this is the identifier that is in the
;; body of the expanded contract (not the surface identifier). That mapping
;; couldn't have happened prior to checking sub because no dependency knows its
;; own expanded identifier (due to how ->i expands, we place the dependencies'
;; identifiers in the body of the contract for later recovery post-expansion;
;; without that trick, maybe a walk over the entire expanded syntax from ->i
;; could recover this; maybe there's even other macro-trickery to simplify this
;; further). Thus, after checking any contract, we pass along its full type by
;; mapping its surface identifier to that type. This works because all contracts
;; know their own surface identifier and all contracts know the surface
;; identifiers of their dependencies.
